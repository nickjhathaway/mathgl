Description: MathGL is a library for the plotting of the data
 MathGL is a free library of fast C++ routines for the plotting
 of the data varied in one or more dimensions. It uses OpenGL
 (www.opengl.org) for the plotting. Also there is a simple window
 interface based on GLUT. This provides high compatibility with
 any operating system (really any which has OpenGL-like libraries).
